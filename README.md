# Basic_practice_list
In Python, a list is a built-in data structure that is used to store an ordered collection of items. Lists are versatile and can contain elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists. Lists are created by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of items inside square brackets [ ].
### Key characteristics of lists in Python include:
- Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements, meaning the order in which you add items to the list is preserved.
- Mutable: Lists are mutable, which means you can change, add, or remove elements after the list is created.
- Mixed Data Types: Lists can hold elements of different data types within the same list.
- Indexing: You can access individual elements in a list using their index. Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

# List Methods
## 1. append() :
Adds an element at the end of the list
## 2. clear():
Removes all the elements from the list
## 3. copy():
Returns a copy of the list
## 4. count():
Returns the number of elements with the specified value
## 5. extend():
Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
## 6. index():
Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
## 7. insert():
Adds an element at the specified position
## 8. pop():
Removes the element at the specified position
## 9. remove():
Removes the item with the specified value
## 10. reverse():
Reverses the order of the list
## 11. sort():
